Conclusions:

1. Based on "Tumor Response to Treatment" and "Tumor Change Over 45 Day Treatment" charts, we can see that only Capomulin had a positive treatment effect to reduce the tumor volume by nearly 20% over 45 days. Whereas Infubinol, Ketapril and Placebo didn't help to treat the tumor, and results showed a growth of around 50% of tumor volume.   

2. Looking at the "Survival During Treatment" chart, we can easily see that mice treated by Capomulin had an outstanding survival rate of 84%, whereas the other 3 treatments only left around 40% mice alive. 

3. According to the metastatic spread during treatment, we can also see that Capomulin decelerated most the spreading speed of tumor, showing averagely 1.5 sites after 45 days, while the other 3 treatments resulted in more than 2 sites over the same period. 


Final conclusion is that based on the test data, we can only accept "Capomulin" among the 4 studied drugs.
